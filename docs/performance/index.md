# Performance and Analysis Reports

The Setuav Standard provides a structure not only for UAV design but also for storing and sharing the analysis results of that design. This section explains how performance reports are structured.

## Overview

Unlike a design file (`design.yaml`), performance reports (`report.yaml`) represent the **outputs** generated by an analysis tool or test process. This distinction separates the lifecycles of design data and result data.

## Report Structure

A Setuav performance report (`report.json` schema) consists of **pure numerical data** gathered into four main categories:

1.  **Aerodynamics (`aerodynamics`)**: Basic aerodynamic coefficients and polars.
2.  **Stability (`stability`)**: Static stability metrics and derivatives.
3.  **Flight Performance (`flight`)**: Speeds, climb rates, range, and endurance.
4.  **Propulsion Performance (`propulsion`)**: Static thrust, power consumption, and efficiency.

## Interpretation and Flags

The Setuav report format does **not include** textual judgments or flags such as "Stable", "Unstable", or "Feasible". The report format stores only objective, calculated engineering data. The interpretation of this data (e.g., whether a 5% static margin is "sufficient") is the responsibility of the engineer or the tool reading the data.

## Schema Reference

Report files can be validated using the `schemas/report.json` schema.

```bash
python3 validate.py my_analysis_result.yaml schemas/report.json
```
